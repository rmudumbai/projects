However, in order for it to do this most effectively, you, as a model developer, have to find the best settings of the model and the training process. For example, you have to decide how many layers the model should have and for how long the model should be trained. These types of parameters that are configured before a model begins training are called **hyperparameters**. In this lab, you will explore how changing two types of hyperparameters affects how well the model can learn and generalize.\n",
