def test_construct_operations(

  """Tests a student's implementation of a function that builds MLP layers.

  This function validates that the student's `construct_operations` function
  correctly generates a list of Keras layers for a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
  based on specified hidden layer dimensions and the number of output classes.

  It runs two primary test cases:
  1.  No hidden layers: A simple logistic regression-style model. It
      checks if the function produces exactly two layers: a `Dense` layer for
      the weighted sum and a `Softmax` layer for the output probabilities.
      It also verifies that the `Dense` layer has the correct output dimension
      (equal to `n_classes`).
  2.  Multiple hidden layers: A deeper MLP. It checks if the function
      correctly interleaves `Dense` and `ReLU` activation layers for each
      specified hidden dimension. It then verifies that the final output
      consists of a `Dense` layer and a `Softmax` layer. The output dimensions
      of all `Dense` layers are also checked for correctness.

  The function provides user-friendly feedback if any of the checks fail,
  guiding the student toward the correct implementation.

  Args:
    construct_operations: A function handle to the student's implementation.
      This function is expected to take two arguments:
      - hidden_dims: A list where each integer specifies the number of neurons
        in a hidden layer. An empty list signifies no hidden layers.
      - n_classes: The number of neurons in the final output layer,
        corresponding to the number of classes for classification.
      It should return a list of Keras `Layer` objects.
