This module provides a function to test a learner's custom simple word
tokenizer, checking its internal vocabulary and the consistency of its encode
and decode methods.

  This function performs two checks:
  1. It validates that the simple word tokenizer's internal vocabulary matches
     the expected vocabulary.
  2. It ensures that encoding a sentence and then decoding it results in the
     original text.

  Args:
    tokenizer: The learner's custom tokenizer object to be tested.
    vocabulary: The expected list of vocabulary tokens.
    train_dataset: A list of sentences for testing the encode/decode
      functionality.

    1. <b>Vocabulary Check:</b> It verifies that the vocabulary stored inside

    2. <b>Encode/Decode Check:</b> It tests if encoding a sentence and then
